📱 Club Connect – iOS Application

UIKit · SwiftUI | February 2024 – November 2024

Club Connect is a modern iOS application designed to centralize college club and event information into a single, intuitive platform. The app simplifies how students discover, explore, and participate in campus activities, improving engagement and accessibility across the academic ecosystem.
